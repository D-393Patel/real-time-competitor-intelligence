# 📌 Milestone 1: Project Infrastructure & Neural Network from Scratch

## 📖 Overview

This milestone focuses on setting up the project infrastructure, installing essential tools, and implementing a **Deep Neural Network from scratch using NumPy**.  
The model is designed for **classification tasks**, with a primary focus on **MNIST digit recognition**.

No high-level deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow / PyTorch) are used, ensuring a strong understanding of **core neural network concepts** such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- NumPy – Numerical computation  
- Pillow (PIL) – Image preprocessing  
- Matplotlib – Training visualization

## 🧠 Deep Neural Network Architecture

The `DeepNeuralNetwork` class implements a **4-layer feedforward neural network**:

Input Layer (784)
↓
Hidden Layer 1 (128 neurons)
↓
Hidden Layer 2 (64 neurons)
↓
Output Layer (10 classes)


### 🔑 Key Parameters

- `sizes` – Defines neurons per layer (e.g., `[784, 128, 64, 10]`)
- `epochs` – Number of full training passes
- `learning_rate` – Controls weight update step size

Weights are initialized using **scaled random normal initialization** to reduce exploding and vanishing gradients.

## 🔁 Core Components

### ⚙️ Activation Functions

**Sigmoid**
- Used in hidden layers
- Maps values between 0 and 1
- Includes derivative computation for backpropagation

**Softmax**
- Used in the output layer
- Converts raw scores into probability distributions

---

### 📉 Loss Function

**Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**
- Computes prediction error
- Supports gradient calculation for backpropagation

---

## 🔄 Forward & Backward Propagation

### ▶️ Forward Pass
- Computes weighted sums and activations layer by layer
- Stores intermediate values for backpropagation

### ◀️ Backward Pass
- Implements backpropagation to compute gradients
- Uses the chain rule with activation and loss derivatives

### 🔧 Parameter Update
- Uses **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- Weight update rule:
W = W - learning_rate × gradient
---

## 📊 Training & Evaluation

- The `train()` method handles epoch-wise training
- Computes training and validation accuracy & loss
- Metrics are stored and plotted to visualize learning trends

---

## 🖼️ Image Preprocessing

The `preprocess_image()` function performs the following steps:

- Loads image using Pillow
- Converts to grayscale
- Resizes to 28 × 28
- Normalizes pixel values
- Flattens into a 784-length vector

---

## 🔍 Digit Prediction

The `predict_digit()` function:

- Reshapes image input into column format
- Performs a forward pass
- Uses `argmax` to predict the digit (0–9)

---

## 📈 Experimental Observations (ReLU Activation)

### ⚙️ Configuration

- Learning Rate: 0.01
- Epochs: 100

### 📊 Results

- Training Accuracy: 99.90%
- Validation Accuracy: 97.45%
- Training Loss: 0.0117
- Validation Loss: 0.0825

### 🧪 Analysis

ReLU activation significantly outperforms sigmoid in convergence speed and validation accuracy.  
A small train–validation gap indicates mild overfitting, but overall performance is strong, making **ReLU the most effective activation** tested for this architecture.
