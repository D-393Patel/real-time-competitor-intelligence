Yet today there is only one\u2014homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

More than 140 years pre-Hillary, there was Victoria Woodhull. This book takes you back with a breathtaking, present-tense bird's eye view into a time when women's liberation was primarily confined to one woman's very capable, independent mind.

But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.\""-Tim Wise, author, \""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son\"" \""The Coming Woman\"" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote Running for President wasn't Victoria's only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote. In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world. This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality. Victoria's epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters."", ""industryIdentifiers"": [{""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1941644112""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781941644119""}], ""readingModes"": {""text"": false, ""image"": false}, ""pageCount"": 334, ""printType"": ""BOOK"", ""categories"": [""Feminism""], ""maturityRating"": ""NOT_MATURE"", ""allowAnonLogging"": false, ""contentVersion"": ""preview-1.0.0"", ""panelizationSummary"": {""containsEpubBubbles"": false, ""containsImageBubbles"": false}, ""imageLinks"": {""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api""}, ""language"": ""en"", ""previewLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Woman:+A+Novel+Based+on+the+Life+of+the+Infamous+Feminist,+Victoria+Woodhull&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"", ""infoLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Coming+Woman:+A+Novel+Based+on+the+Life+of+the+Infamous+Feminist,+Victoria+Woodhull&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""canonicalVolumeLink"": ""https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Coming_Woman.html?hl=&id=MJqpoAEACAAJ""}, ""saleInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""saleability"": ""NOT_FOR_SALE"", ""isEbook"": false}, ""accessInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""viewability"": ""NO_PAGES"", ""embeddable"": false, ""publicDomain"": false, ""textToSpeechPermission"": ""ALLOWED"", ""epub"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""pdf"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""webReaderLink"": ""http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MJqpoAEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""accessViewStatus"": ""NONE"", ""quoteSharingAllowed"": false}, ""searchInfo"": {""textSnippet"": ""&quot;The Coming woman is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote&quot;--Amazon.com""}}]}"

Andrew located the first steampunk short story, which has not been republished since 1844. There is the first voyage to the moon in a balloon, republished for the first time since 1820 that further tells of a darkness machine and a lunarian named Zuloc. Other sci-stories include the first robotic insect and an electricity gun.

Whether she\u2019s fleeing from ravenous lions, dancing amid smoking skulls, trekking Annapurna underprepared, or (accidentally) drugging an Englishman, Sue\u2019s quick-witted, self-deprecating narrative might just inspire you to take your own chaotic adventure."", ""industryIdentifiers"": [{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781927366486""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1927366488""}], ""readingModes"": {""text"": true, ""image"": true}, ""pageCount"": 155, ""printType"": ""BOOK"", ""categories"": [""Travel""], ""maturityRating"": ""NOT_MATURE"", ""allowAnonLogging"": true, ""contentVersion"": ""1.3.3.0.preview.3"", ""panelizationSummary"": {""containsEpubBubbles"": false, ""containsImageBubbles"": false}, ""imageLinks"": {""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}, ""language"": ""en"", ""previewLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=It%27s+Only+the+Himalayas&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"", ""infoLink"": ""https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"", ""canonicalVolumeLink"": ""https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ""}, ""saleInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""saleability"": ""FOR_SALE"", ""isEbook"": true, ""listPrice"": {""amount"": 8.99, ""currencyCode"": ""USD""}, ""retailPrice"": {""amount"": 8.99, ""currencyCode"": ""USD""}, ""buyLink"": ""https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-snA_CwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api"", ""offers"": [{""finskyOfferType"": 1, ""listPrice"": {""amountInMicros"": 8990000, ""currencyCode"": ""USD""}, ""retailPrice"": {""amountInMicros"": 8990000, ""currencyCode"": ""USD""}, ""giftable"": true}]}, ""accessInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""viewability"": ""PARTIAL"", ""embeddable"": true, ""publicDomain"": false, ""textToSpeechPermission"": ""ALLOWED"", ""epub"": {""isAvailable"": true, ""acsTokenLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books/download/It_s_Only_the_Himalayas-sample-epub.acsm?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api""}, ""pdf"": {""isAvailable"": true, ""acsTokenLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books/download/It_s_Only_the_Himalayas-sample-pdf.acsm?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api""}, ""webReaderLink"": ""http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=snA_CwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""accessViewStatus"": ""SAMPLE"", ""quoteSharingAllowed"": false}, ""searchInfo"": {""textSnippet"": ""A laugh-out-loud travel memoir that reveals backpacking\u2019s awkward side.""}}]}"

En route, Dickson traces Nazi Germany\u2019s strange love affair with, and attempted nationalization of, the Bard, and delves deep into the history of Bollywood, where Shakespearean stories helped give birth to Indian cinema. In Johannesburg, we discover how Shakespeare was enlisted in the fight to end apartheid. In nineteenth-century California, we encounter shoestring performances of Richard III and Othello in the dusty mining camps and saloon bars of the Gold Rush. No other writer\u2019s work has been performed, translated, adapted, and altered in such a remarkable variety of cultures and languages.

You probably remember the story of the bear who found the piano in the woods and grew up to become a huge star. He played his music in front of millions of adoring fans and all of his wildest dreams came true. But now, the audiences are smaller, the pianos less grand, and the applause is dying away. So Bear decides to retire. Back in the woods, he is sad that his dream is over but he soon has something to distract him: Little Bear! When Little Bear stumbles upon his piano in the woods, she can't believe it when her father says that no one wants to hear his music anymore. So she comes up with a plan to prove him wrong. The final book in the award-winning, best-selling trilogy shows that while fame and fortune might be temporary, the best songs stay in your heart forever. **Don't miss David Litchfield's other books: The Bear and the Piano (1) The Bear, the Piano, The Dog and the Fiddle (2) The Bear, the Piano, and Little Bear's Concert (3) Grandad's Secret Giant Lights on Cotton Rock"", ""industryIdentifiers"": [{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9780711247246""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""0711247242""}], ""readingModes"": {""text"": false, ""image"": true}, ""pageCount"": 41, ""printType"": ""BOOK"", ""categories"": [""Juvenile Nonfiction""], ""maturityRating"": ""NOT_MATURE"", ""allowAnonLogging"": false, ""contentVersion"": ""0.1.2.0.preview.1"", ""panelizationSummary"": {""containsEpubBubbles"": false, ""containsImageBubbles"": false}, ""imageLinks"": {""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}, ""language"": ""en"", ""previewLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Bear+and+the+Piano&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"", ""infoLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bear+and+the+Piano&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""canonicalVolumeLink"": ""https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Bear_the_Piano_and_Little_Bear_s_Con.html?hl=&id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ""}, ""saleInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""saleability"": ""NOT_FOR_SALE"", ""isEbook"": false}, ""accessInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""viewability"": ""PARTIAL"", ""embeddable"": true, ""publicDomain"": false, ""textToSpeechPermission"": ""ALLOWED"", ""epub"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""pdf"": {""isAvailable"": true, ""acsTokenLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Bear_the_Piano_and_Little_Bear_s_Con-sample-pdf.acsm?id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api""}, ""webReaderLink"": ""http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=WB_3DwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""accessViewStatus"": ""SAMPLE"", ""quoteSharingAllowed"": false}, ""searchInfo"": {""textSnippet"": ""The final book in the award-winning, best-selling trilogy shows that while fame and fortune might be temporary, the best songs stay in your heart forever. **Don&#39;t miss David Litchfield&#39;s other books: The Bear and the Piano (1) The Bear, the ...""}}]}"

His powerful new collection offers a poetry that simultaneously explores hope and horror while documenting the transformative processes of coping. You can't bury them all follows the narratives we construct to survive the tragic failures of our humanity to their very end: everything that's buried by snow, dirt, and ash, just like everything that's buried by politics, homophobia, sexism, racism, religion, and history is resurrected, demanding to be heard and addressed. In Woodcock's poetry, how we deal with what resurfaces is the key. What do those who suffer really mean to those who have abandoned them to small, conscience-soothing charitable donations or the occasional tweet? How can the poet, or anyone else, sleep at night after YouTube documents homosexual Kurds being thrown off building tops; after a child's body is abandoned in an Azeri cemetery; or after the elders of an Aboriginal community are left helpless against businessmen who only want to exploit them? Still, You can't bury them all demonstrates that the world is not just the horrific place the media often portrays.

Navigating the fault lines of popular culture and traditional poetry to assert that we are all history makers, Slow States of Collapse enters the landscape of personal narrative in an attempt to reconcile life's little universal griefs. Slow States of Collapse presents a world that is at once menacing and full of wonder and grace. It's a poetry of ''casual cruelty'' and ''kisses like / puncture wounds,'' of ''something too tender to touch'' and ''the threat of an intense beauty.''

Charming and unfiltered, she refuses to be held down by the medicine she's told should make her feel better. After meeting Jonah, she slides into the Daniels' household seamlessly, winning over each sibling with her imagination and gameness. But it's not long before Vivi's zest for life begins to falter. Soon her adventurousness becomes all-out danger-seeking. Through each high and low, Vivi and Jonah's love is put to the test . . . but what happens when love simply isn't enough?"", ""industryIdentifiers"": [{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781619638457""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1619638452""}], ""readingModes"": {""text"": false, ""image"": true}, ""pageCount"": 355, ""printType"": ""BOOK"", ""categories"": [""Juvenile Fiction""], ""maturityRating"": ""NOT_MATURE"", ""allowAnonLogging"": false, ""contentVersion"": ""0.1.2.0.preview.1"", ""panelizationSummary"": {""containsEpubBubbles"": false, ""containsImageBubbles"": false}, ""imageLinks"": {""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}, ""language"": ""en"", ""previewLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=When+We+Collided&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"", ""infoLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ&dq=When+We+Collided&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""canonicalVolumeLink"": ""https://books.google.com/books/about/When_We_Collided.html?hl=&id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ""}, ""saleInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""saleability"": ""NOT_FOR_SALE"", ""isEbook"": false}, ""accessInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""viewability"": ""PARTIAL"", ""embeddable"": true, ""publicDomain"": false, ""textToSpeechPermission"": ""ALLOWED"", ""epub"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""pdf"": {""isAvailable"": true, ""acsTokenLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books/download/When_We_Collided-sample-pdf.acsm?id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api""}, ""webReaderLink"": ""http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GfdaEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""accessViewStatus"": ""SAMPLE"", ""quoteSharingAllowed"": false}, ""searchInfo"": {""textSnippet"": ""&quot;Can seventeen-year-old Jonah save his family restaurant from ruin, his mother from her sadness, and his danger-seeking girlfriend Vivi from herself?&quot;--""}}]}"

Although we usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors began to create the first technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and weapons. Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins. The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations. Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe. Unbound explains both how we got here and how human society must be transformed again to achieve a sustainable future. Technology: \u201cThe deliberate modification of any natural object or substance with forethought to achieve a specific end or to serve a specific purpose.\u201d"", ""industryIdentifiers"": [{""type"": ""ISBN_13"", ""identifier"": ""9781628727760""}, {""type"": ""ISBN_10"", ""identifier"": ""1628727764""}], ""readingModes"": {""text"": true, ""image"": false}, ""pageCount"": 490, ""printType"": ""BOOK"", ""categories"": [""Social Science""], ""maturityRating"": ""NOT_MATURE"", ""allowAnonLogging"": true, ""contentVersion"": ""1.3.4.0.preview.2"", ""panelizationSummary"": {""containsEpubBubbles"": false, ""containsImageBubbles"": false}, ""imageLinks"": {""smallThumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"", ""thumbnail"": ""http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api""}, ""language"": ""en"", ""previewLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Unbound:+How+Eight+Technologies+Made+Us+Human,+Transformed+Society,+and+Brought+Our+World+to+the+Brink&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"", ""infoLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books?id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ&dq=Unbound:+How+Eight+Technologies+Made+Us+Human,+Transformed+Society,+and+Brought+Our+World+to+the+Brink&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""canonicalVolumeLink"": ""https://books.google.com/books/about/Unbound.html?hl=&id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ""}, ""saleInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""saleability"": ""NOT_FOR_SALE"", ""isEbook"": false}, ""accessInfo"": {""country"": ""US"", ""viewability"": ""PARTIAL"", ""embeddable"": true, ""publicDomain"": false, ""textToSpeechPermission"": ""ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY"", ""epub"": {""isAvailable"": true, ""acsTokenLink"": ""http://books.google.com/books/download/Unbound-sample-epub.acsm?id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api""}, ""pdf"": {""isAvailable"": false}, ""webReaderLink"": ""http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=7ri8DgAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api"", ""accessViewStatus"": ""SAMPLE"", ""quoteSharingAllowed"": false}, ""searchInfo"": {""textSnippet"": ""Like Guns, Germs, and Steel, a work of breathtaking sweep and originality that reinterprets the human story.""}}]}"

They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her father's longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Beth's own daughter, Riva, acting as Andrea's attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her father's home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholas's on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholas's at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Don's wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andrea's father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andrea's closest high school friend, Jason. After Jason's death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Beth's old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governor's seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to come--the discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governor's seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michael's whereabouts on the night they are shot.

In the center of the verdant Monarchy lies Dreadwillow Carse, a black and desolate bog that the happy people of the land do their best to ignore. Little is known about it, except for one dire warning: If any monarch enters Dreadwillow Carse, then the Monarchy will fall. Twelve-year-old Princess Jeniah yearns to know what the marsh could possibly conceal that might topple her family\u2019s thousand-year reign of peace and prosperity. Meanwhile, in the nearby town of Emberfell, where everyone lives with unending joy, a girl named Aon hides a sorrow she can never reveal. She knows that something in the carse--something that sings a haunting tune only Aon can hear--holds the cure for her sadness. Yet no matter how many times she tries to enter, the terror-inducing dreadwillow trees keep her away. After a chance meeting, Princess Jeniah and Aon hatch a plan to send Aon into the heart of the carse to unlock its darkest secret. But when Aon doesn\u2019t return, a guilt-stricken Jeniah must enter the carse to try and rescue her friend--even if it means risking the entire Monarchy.
