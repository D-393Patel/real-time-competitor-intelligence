        "    Yes, the limitation was acknowledged, stating that UPC codes from 'books.toscrape.com' are not standard ISBNs and cannot be used with ISBN-based APIs like `booksrun.com`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Was the querying of the booksrun.com API successful?**\n",
        "    Yes, the technical process of querying the `booksrun.com` API was successful. HTTP GET requests were constructed and executed, and JSON responses were retrieved for all mock ISBNs. However, due to the invalid nature of the mock ISBNs, no actual competitor prices were extracted; instead, the API returned a \"Wrong Isbn\" error for every request.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **UPC to ISBN Conversion Limitation:** It was confirmed that UPC codes from 'books.toscrape.com' are not compatible with ISBN-based APIs like `booksrun.com`.\n",
        "*   **Mock ISBN Generation:** 10 mock ISBNs were successfully generated for testing purposes, varying in length (10 or 13 digits), for example, `['3200299017740', '9016222033']`.\n",
        "*   **API Query Execution:** HTTP GET requests were successfully constructed and executed for all 10 mock ISBNs using the provided API key.\n",
        "*   **API Response for Mock ISBNs:** All 10 mock ISBNs resulted in an \"error\" status from the `booksrun.com` API with the message \"Wrong Isbn,\" indicating they were not recognized as valid books.\n",
        "*   **Price Extraction Failure:** Consequently, no competitor prices could be extracted from the API responses due to the invalid mock ISBNs. The extracted price field correctly reported \"No offers available\" or a similar message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   To obtain meaningful pricing data, future API calls should use actual, valid ISBNs rather than randomly generated mock ISBNs.\n",
        "*   The current process effectively demonstrates the API interaction and error handling; for a production-ready solution, a mechanism to acquire or validate ISBNs would be crucial.\n"

        "## Summary: Price Adjustment Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview\n",
        "This task involved scraping book information from 'books.toscrape.com', obtaining valid ISBNs for these books using the Google Books API, fetching competitor prices from 'booksrun.com' using these ISBNs, and finally, performing a dynamic price adjustment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Findings\n",
        "1.  **Data Acquisition:**\n",
        "    *   Successfully scraped UPC codes, book titles, and prices from all pages of 'books.toscrape.com' for approximately 1000 books.\n",
        "    *   Loaded the scraped data into a pandas DataFrame (`df_books`).\n",
        "2.  **ISBN Retrieval:**\n",
        "    *   Used the Google Books API to search for ISBNs (prioritizing ISBN-13, then ISBN-10) for the first 60 books from the scraped list.\n",
        "    *   A significant number of valid ISBNs were successfully retrieved, though some titles did not yield an ISBN or returned 'N/A'.\n",
        "3.  **Competitor Price Fetching:**\n",
        "    *   Queried the 'booksrun.com' API using the retrieved real ISBNs and the provided API key.\n",
        "    *   Implemented robust logic to extract competitor prices (new or used, from 'booksrun' or 'marketplace' offers) from the API's JSON responses.\n",
        "    *   Handled cases where no offers were available or the ISBN was invalid, marking them appropriately.\n",
        "4.  **Data Preparation for Analysis:**\n",
        "    *   Merged the original scraped data, Google Books ISBNs, and 'booksrun.com' competitor prices into a unified DataFrame (`final_comparison_df`).\n",
        "    *   Cleaned and converted all price strings to numerical (float) values for consistent comparison, handling currency symbols and descriptive text.\n",
        "    *   Added 'ISBN' and a clickable 'Booksrun Link' column to facilitate direct lookup of books.\n",
        "5.  **Price Comparison & Dynamic Adjustment:**\n",
        "    *   Calculated absolute and percentage price differences between the original and competitor prices.\n",
        "    *   Implemented a **dynamic price adjustment strategy** that does not rely on constant increases or decreases, but instead aims for real-time profit optimization:\n",
        "        *   **Tolerance:** A relative tolerance (1% of the original price) was used to define 'approximate equality', making the system adaptive to different price points.\n",
        "        *   **Reduction for Competitiveness:** If the original price was significantly higher than the competitor's, a new target price was suggested (e.g., 105% of the competitor's price) to make the product competitive while preserving a margin, capped at the original price to prevent unintended increases.\n",
        "        *   **Increase for Profit Optimization:** If the original price was significantly lower than the competitor's, a new target price was suggested (e.g., 95% of the competitor's price) to boost profitability while maintaining a competitive edge, floored at the original price to prevent unintended reductions.\n",
        "        *   **Maintain Price:** If prices were approximately equal within the tolerance, the strategy recommended maintaining the current price.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strategic Outcomes & Insights\n",
        "*   The analysis successfully identified books where pricing adjustments could be made to improve competitiveness or increase profit margins based on real-time competitor data.\n",
        "*   For books where 'booksrun.com' offered significantly lower prices, the system provided actionable recommendations for price reduction with specific target prices.\n",
        "*   Conversely, for books where the original price was already lower, opportunities for profit optimization through slight price increases were highlighted.\n",
        "*   The inclusion of ISBNs and direct Booksrun.com links in the final analysis table enhances usability for quick verification and manual adjustment if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Automated Price Updates:** For a true real-time scenario, the suggested price actions could be integrated with an inventory management or e-commerce platform to automate price adjustments.\n",
        "*   **Currency Conversion:** While prices were normalized to floats, a future enhancement could involve explicit currency conversion (e.g., GBP to USD) for a more accurate financial comparison.\n",
        "*   **Expanded Data:** Apply the analysis to the full scraped dataset (all 1000 books) for a broader market overview and more comprehensive pricing strategy.\n",
        "*   **Advanced Margin Analysis:** Incorporate cost data and desired profit margins into the dynamic pricing algorithm to refine target prices further."

        "## Dynamic Price Adjustment Strategy Explained (Scenario: Original Price Higher)\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break down how the dynamic pricing strategy works when your original price is significantly higher than the competitor's, using **'Sharp Objects'** as an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Book Example: 'Sharp Objects'**\n",
        "*   **Original Price (Float):** $47.82 (your price)\n",
        "*   **Competitor Price (Float):** $4.99 (BooksRun price)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps the `suggest_price_action_dynamic` function takes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Calculate `price_equality_tolerance`:**\n",
        "    *   This tolerance helps decide if prices are 'close enough' to be considered equal, avoiding unnecessary tiny adjustments.\n",
        "    *   It's set as `0.01 * original_price` (1% of your book's current price).\n",
        "    *   For 'Sharp Objects': `0.01 * $47.82 = $0.4782`\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Check Condition for Price Reduction:**\n",
        "    *   The function looks for cases where `original_price > competitor_price + price_equality_tolerance`.\n",
        "    *   For 'Sharp Objects': `$47.82 > $4.99 + $0.4782`\n",
        "    *   This simplifies to: `$47.82 > $5.4682`. Since this is `True`, the function identifies that your price is significantly higher than the competitor's.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Determine `suggested_new_price` for Competitiveness:**\n",
        "    *   **Goal:** Bring your price down to be competitive, but try to retain some profit margin if possible.\n",
        "    *   The function calculates a potential new price based on the `competitive_margin_above` factor (which defaults to 1.05 or 105%). This means aiming for a price that is 5% *above* the competitor's price.\n",
        "    *   Calculated target: `competitor_price * 1.05 = $4.99 * 1.05 = $5.2395`\n",
        "    *   **Crucially:** The function then takes the *minimum* of your current `original_price` and this calculated target. This ensures you never suggest a new price that's *higher* than what you're already charging, especially when your current price is very high.\n",
        "    *   `suggested_new_price = min($47.82, $5.2395)`\n",
        "    *   Therefore, `suggested_new_price = $5.2395` (which would typically be rounded to $5.24).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Formulate the Action:**\n",
        "    *   Based on these calculations, the function outputs:\n",
        "        \"**Reduce Price for Competitiveness: Target approx. $5.24 (from $47.82)**\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**In Summary:** Even though the tolerance uses a constant factor (0.01), the *result* (`$0.4782` in this case) scales dynamically with the book's price. The overall strategy is dynamic because it looks at the relationship between your price and the competitor's, and then calculates a *specific new target price* that aims to make you competitive (e.g., slightly above the competitor) without undercutting yourself unnecessarily."

        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Price Differences Calculation:** The analysis successfully calculated the 'Absolute Price Difference' (Original Price - Competitor Price) and the 'Percentage Price Difference' between the 'Original Price (Float)' and 'Competitor Price (Float)' for each book.\n",
        "*   **Suggested Price Actions:** A 'Suggested Price Action' column was added, providing strategic recommendations for each book:\n",
        "    *   'Reduce Price (to be competitive)': Recommended when the original price is higher than the competitor's price.\n",
        "    *   'Increase Price (potential for higher profit)': Recommended when the original price is lower than the competitor's price.\n",
        "    *   'Maintain Price (prices are equal)': Recommended when prices are identical.\n",
        "    *   'Price not available from one/both sources': Indicated when price data was missing.\n",
        "*   **Data Preparation & Robustness:** The process involved re-creating the `final_comparison_df` from previous steps, including cleaning and converting price strings to numerical format. It also handled potential division by zero errors during percentage calculation and successfully resolved initial `NameError` and `SyntaxError` during development.\n",

        "## Summary: Price Adjustment Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overview\n",
        "This task involved scraping book information from 'books.toscrape.com', obtaining valid ISBNs for these books using the Google Books API, fetching competitor prices from 'booksrun.com' using these ISBNs, and finally, performing a dynamic price adjustment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Findings\n",
        "1.  **Data Acquisition:**\n",
        "    *   Successfully scraped UPC codes, book titles, and prices from all pages of 'books.toscrape.com' for approximately 1000 books.\n",
        "    *   Loaded the scraped data into a pandas DataFrame (`df_books`).\n",
        "2.  **ISBN Retrieval:**\n",
        "    *   Used the Google Books API to search for ISBNs (prioritizing ISBN-13, then ISBN-10) for the first 60 books from the scraped list.\n",
        "    *   A significant number of valid ISBNs were successfully retrieved, though some titles did not yield an ISBN or returned 'N/A'.\n",
        "3.  **Competitor Price Fetching:**\n",
        "    *   Queried the 'booksrun.com' API using the retrieved real ISBNs and the provided API key.\n",
        "    *   Implemented robust logic to extract competitor prices (new or used, from 'booksrun' or 'marketplace' offers) from the API's JSON responses.\n",
        "    *   Handled cases where no offers were available or the ISBN was invalid, marking them appropriately.\n",
        "4.  **Data Preparation for Analysis:**\n",
        "    *   Merged the original scraped data, Google Books ISBNs, and 'booksrun.com' competitor prices into a unified DataFrame (`final_comparison_df`).\n",
        "    *   Cleaned and converted all price strings to numerical (float) values for consistent comparison, handling currency symbols and descriptive text.\n",
        "    *   Added 'ISBN' and a clickable 'Booksrun Link' column to facilitate direct lookup of books.\n",
        "5.  **Price Comparison & Dynamic Adjustment:**\n",
        "    *   Calculated absolute and percentage price differences between the original and competitor prices.\n",
        "    *   Implemented a **dynamic price adjustment strategy** that does not rely on constant increases or decreases, but instead aims for real-time profit optimization:\n",
        "        *   **Tolerance:** A relative tolerance (1% of the original price) was used to define 'approximate equality', making the system adaptive to different price points.\n",
        "        *   **Tiered Adjustment:** Initially, fixed `competitive_margin_above` and `competitive_margin_below` constants were used. This evolved into a *tiered strategy* where these margins are dynamically determined based on the magnitude of the percentage price difference. This allows for more aggressive reductions when prices are drastically high, and more controlled increases when prices are slightly low, making the adjustments more nuanced and responsive.\n",
        "        *   **LLM Integration (Simulated):** Further enhanced the dynamic strategy by simulating LLM-derived margins for specific books. This demonstrated how external intelligence could provide highly customized `competitive_margin_above` and `competitive_margin_below` values, overriding or complementing the tiered logic based on a broader contextual understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strategic Outcomes & Insights\n",
        "*   The analysis successfully identified books where pricing adjustments could be made to improve competitiveness or increase profit margins based on real-time competitor data.\n",
        "*   The evolution of the pricing strategy from simple constants to a tiered approach, and finally to LLM-informed margins, showcases a progression towards more intelligent and adaptive pricing.\n",
        "*   For books where 'booksrun.com' offered significantly lower prices, the system provided actionable recommendations for price reduction with specific target prices, becoming more aggressive with larger discrepancies.\n",
        "*   Conversely, for books where the original price was already lower, opportunities for profit optimization through slight price increases were highlighted, with the magnitude of increase adapted to the price difference.\n",
        "*   The inclusion of ISBNs and direct Booksrun.com links in the final analysis table enhances usability for quick verification and manual adjustment if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Automated Price Updates:** For a true real-time scenario, the suggested price actions could be integrated with an inventory management or e-commerce platform to automate price adjustments.\n",
        "*   **Currency Conversion:** While prices were normalized to floats, a future enhancement could involve explicit currency conversion (e.g., GBP to USD) for a more accurate financial comparison.\n",
        "*   **Expanded Data:** Apply the analysis to the full scraped dataset (all 1000 books) for a broader market overview and more comprehensive pricing strategy.\n",
        "*   **Advanced Margin Analysis:** Incorporate cost data and desired profit margins into the dynamic pricing algorithm to refine target prices further, potentially using LLM insights to inform these costs and desired margins as well."

The LLM's 'broader contextual understanding' (simulated here) might indicate that for this particular book, customers are willing to pay a slight premium above the absolute lowest competitor price.\n",

        "This task involved scraping book information from 'books.toscrape.com', obtaining valid ISBNs for these books using the Google Books API, fetching competitor prices from 'booksrun.com' using these ISBNs, and finally, performing a dynamic price adjustment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Findings\n",
        "1.  **Data Acquisition:**\n",
        "    *   Successfully scraped UPC codes, book titles, and prices from all pages of 'books.toscrape.com' for approximately 1000 books.\n",
        "    *   Loaded the scraped data into a pandas DataFrame (`df_books`).\n",
        "2.  **ISBN Retrieval:**\n",
        "    *   Used the Google Books API to search for ISBNs (prioritizing ISBN-13, then ISBN-10) for the first 60 books from the scraped list.\n",
        "    *   A significant number of valid ISBNs were successfully retrieved, though some titles did not yield an ISBN or returned 'N/A'.\n",
        "3.  **Competitor Price Fetching:**\n",
        "    *   Queried the 'booksrun.com' API using the retrieved real ISBNs and the provided API key.\n",
        "    *   Implemented robust logic to extract competitor prices (new or used, from 'booksrun' or 'marketplace' offers) from the API's JSON responses.\n",
        "    *   Handled cases where no offers were available or the ISBN was invalid, marking them appropriately.\n",
        "4.  **Data Preparation for Analysis:**\n",
        "    *   Merged the original scraped data, Google Books ISBNs, and 'booksrun.com' competitor prices into a unified DataFrame (`final_comparison_df`).\n",
        "    *   Cleaned and converted all price strings to numerical (float) values for consistent comparison, handling currency symbols and descriptive text.\n",
        "    *   Added 'ISBN' and a clickable 'Booksrun Link' column to facilitate direct lookup of books.\n",
        "5.  **Price Comparison & Dynamic Adjustment:**\n",
        "    *   Calculated absolute and percentage price differences between the original and competitor prices.\n",
        "    *   Implemented a **dynamic price adjustment strategy** that does not rely on constant increases or decreases, but instead aims for real-time profit optimization:\n",
        "        *   **Tolerance:** A relative tolerance (1% of the original price) was used to define 'approximate equality', making the system adaptive to different price points.\n",
        "        *   **Tiered Adjustment:** Initially, fixed `competitive_margin_above` and `competitive_margin_below` constants were used. This evolved into a *tiered strategy* where these margins are dynamically determined based on the magnitude of the percentage price difference. This allows for more aggressive reductions when prices are drastically high, and more controlled increases when prices are slightly low, making the adjustments more nuanced and responsive.\n",
        "        *   **LLM Integration (Simulated):** Further enhanced the dynamic strategy by simulating LLM-derived margins for specific books. This demonstrated how external intelligence could provide highly customized `competitive_margin_above` and `competitive_margin_below` values, overriding or complementing the tiered logic based on a broader contextual understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strategic Outcomes & Insights\n",
        "*   The analysis successfully identified books where pricing adjustments could be made to improve competitiveness or increase profit margins based on real-time competitor data.\n",
        "*   The evolution of the pricing strategy from simple constants to a tiered approach, and finally to LLM-informed margins, showcases a progression towards more intelligent and adaptive pricing.\n",
        "*   For books where 'booksrun.com' offered significantly lower prices, the system provided actionable recommendations for price reduction with specific target prices, becoming more aggressive with larger discrepancies.\n",
        "*   Conversely, for books where the original price was already lower, opportunities for profit optimization through slight price increases were highlighted, with the magnitude of increase adapted to the price difference.\n",
        "*   The inclusion of ISBNs and direct Booksrun.com links in the final analysis table enhances usability for quick verification and manual adjustment if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Automated Price Updates:** For a true real-time scenario, the suggested price actions could be integrated with an inventory management or e-commerce platform to automate price adjustments.\n",
        "*   **Currency Conversion:** While prices were normalized to floats, a future enhancement could involve explicit currency conversion (e.g., GBP to USD) for a more accurate financial comparison.\n",
        "*   **Expanded Data:** Apply the analysis to the full scraped dataset (all 1000 books) for a broader market overview and more comprehensive pricing strategy.\n",
        "*   **Advanced Margin Analysis:** Incorporate cost data and desired profit margins into the dynamic pricing algorithm to refine target prices further, potentially using LLM insights to inform these costs and desired margins as well."

        "This report details the development and deployment of a system designed to enhance competitive pricing strategies for an e-commerce platform specializing in books. The core problem addressed is the need for real-time competitor price intelligence to optimize product pricing, ensuring both market competitiveness and maximum profitability. The objective of this module is to automate the process of scraping book information from a primary source, identifying corresponding products on a competitor's platform, and analyzing price discrepancies to suggest optimal price adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Competitor price intelligence is paramount in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape. Accurate and timely information about competitor pricing allows businesses to react swiftly to market changes, prevent underpricing (which leads to lost revenue) or overpricing (which results in lost sales volume), and ultimately drive revenue growth and market share. This system aims to provide actionable insights by identifying books where price adjustments can lead to increased competitiveness or profit optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "High-level workflow of the system:\n",
        "1.  **Data Scraping:** Extract UPC codes, book titles, and prices from a source website (books.toscrape.com).\n",
        "2.  **ISBN Conversion:** Utilize the Google Books API to convert scraped book titles into standard ISBNs (ISBN-13 or ISBN-10), as UPCs are not suitable for book-specific APIs.\n",
        "3.  **Competitor Price Query:** Use the obtained ISBNs to query a competitor's API (booksrun.com) for their pricing data.\n",
        "4.  **Data Integration & Cleaning:** Merge the scraped data, ISBN information, and competitor prices into a unified dataset, cleaning and normalizing price values for comparison.\n",
        "5.  **Price Comparison & Dynamic Adjustment Analysis:** Calculate absolute and percentage price differences and apply a dynamic strategy (including tiered adjustments and simulated LLM insights) to suggest optimal price actions.\n",
        "6.  **Reporting:** Present the analysis in a structured, actionable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Tools & Technologies Used\n",
        "\n",
        "**Python:** Chosen as the primary programming language due to its extensive libraries for web scraping, data manipulation, API interaction, and scientific computing. Its readability and large community support facilitate rapid development and robust solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pandas:** A fundamental data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It was selected for its powerful DataFrame structure, which efficiently handles tabular data. Pandas enabled the seamless loading, merging, cleaning, and transformation of data from various sources (CSV, API responses) into a unified format for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requests:** An elegant and simple HTTP library for Python. It was chosen for making HTTP GET requests to external APIs (Google Books API, BooksRun API). Its user-friendly interface simplifies complex HTTP interactions, ensuring reliable communication with web services.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BeautifulSoup:** A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. While not extensively used in the final API calls, it was instrumental in the initial web scraping phase to parse the HTML structure of 'books.toscrape.com' and extract relevant book information (UPC, Title, Price).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Google Books API:** A robust web service providing access to book information, including ISBNs, based on search queries like book titles. This API was critical for converting the non-standard UPCs from the scraped data into globally recognized ISBNs, which are essential for querying book-specific pricing services.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BooksRun API:** A commercial API providing real-time pricing data for books, often including new, used, and marketplace offers. This API served as the primary competitor data source, enabling the system to fetch crucial pricing intelligence for comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "**CSV Data Storage:** Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format was used for local storage of the initial scraped book data ('booksinfo.csv'). CSV is a simple, universally compatible format ideal for transferring and persisting structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**REST APIs:** Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style was utilized for interacting with both the Google Books API and BooksRun API. REST APIs provide a standardized, stateless communication method over HTTP, making integration with external web services straightforward and efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Task 1: Conversion of UPC Code to ISBN\n",
        "\n",
        "**Difference between UPC and ISBN:**\n",
        "*   **UPC (Universal Product Code):** Primarily used in retail to identify consumer products. It's a 12-digit number typically found on packaging and scanned at points of sale. A single book title can have different UPCs depending on the edition, publisher, or even packaging variations.\n",
        "*   **ISBN (International Standard Book Number):** A unique numeric commercial book identifier. It's a 10-digit (until 2007) or 13-digit (since 2007) number specifically for books and related products. Each edition and format of a book (e.g., paperback, hardcover, e-book) is assigned a different ISBN.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why UPC codes cannot directly be used for book pricing APIs:** Book pricing APIs, especially those used by booksellers and aggregators, rely almost exclusively on ISBNs for accurate product identification. UPCs are too generic for books and do not uniquely identify specific editions, which is crucial for precise price comparison. Therefore, a conversion step is essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method used to extract real ISBNs using Google Books API:**\n",
        "To bridge the gap between the scraped UPC-identified books and ISBN-based pricing APIs, the Google Books API was employed. The methodology involved using the extracted book titles as search queries to the Google Books API, which then returned relevant book information, including available ISBNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**API Request Structure:**\n",
        "For each book title, an HTTP GET request was constructed to the Google Books API endpoint:\n",
        "`https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:** The book's `Title` from the scraped `df_books` DataFrame.\n",
        "**Parameters:**\n",
        "*   `q`: The book title (e.g., `'Sharp Objects'`).\n",
        "*   `maxResults`: Limited to 1 to retrieve the most relevant result.\n",
        "*   `langRestrict`: Set to `'en'` to prioritize English language results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example API Request (conceptual):**\n",
        "`requests.get('https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes', params={'q': 'Sharp Objects', 'maxResults': 1, 'langRestrict': 'en'})`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Response Parsing Logic:**\n",
        "Upon receiving a JSON response from the Google Books API, the system parsed the `items` array to find the `volumeInfo` for the top result. Within `volumeInfo`, it looked for `industryIdentifiers`. These identifiers contain a list of dictionaries, each specifying an identifier `type` (e.g., 'ISBN_13', 'ISBN_10') and its `identifier` value. The parsing logic prioritized `ISBN_13` and fell back to `ISBN_10` if `ISBN_13` was not available or valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Error Handling for Missing ISBNs:** If the Google Books API response did not contain any items or valid `industryIdentifiers`, the `ISBN_13` and `ISBN_10` fields were recorded as 'N/A' or 'Error'. This ensured that books without discoverable ISBNs were gracefully handled without halting the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output generated (list of valid ISBN-10 / ISBN-13):**\n",
        "The output of this task was a list of dictionaries (`books_with_isbns`), where each dictionary contained the 'Original Title', the extracted 'ISBN_13', 'ISBN_10', and the full 'Google Books API Response' for debugging. From this list, a `real_isbns` list was then compiled containing only the valid and consolidated ISBNs for subsequent competitor API calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example UPC → Title → ISBN mapping (Illustrative):**\n",
        "\n",
        "| UPC              | Title           | ISBN-13         | ISBN-10     |\n",

        "### 4. Task 2: Web / API Query for Competitor Pricing\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose of querying competitor pricing:** The primary purpose is to gather competitive intelligence that informs dynamic pricing decisions. By comparing our prices against those of a competitor like BooksRun, we can identify opportunities to:\n",
        "*   Reduce prices to be more competitive and attract more sales.\n",
        "*   Increase prices for products where we are significantly cheaper, thereby optimizing profit margins without losing competitiveness.\n",
        "*   Maintain prices if they are already competitive and optimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BooksRun API endpoint structure:**\n",
        "The BooksRun API provides a specific endpoint for retrieving pricing information for books identified by their ISBN. The structure of the endpoint used is:\n",
        "`https://booksrun.com/api/v3/price/buy/<ISBN>?key=<API_KEY>`\n",
        "\n",
        "**Authentication via API key:** Access to the BooksRun API is authenticated using a unique API key, provided as a query parameter (`key=<API_KEY>`). This key ensures authorized access to the service and tracks API usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**HTTP GET request logic:**\n",
        "The system iterates through the `real_isbns` list obtained from Task 1. For each ISBN, a complete API URL is constructed by embedding the ISBN and the `API_KEY`. An HTTP GET request is then sent to this URL using the `requests` library. Error handling (`response.raise_for_status()`) is included to catch HTTP errors (e.g., 4xx, 5xx responses).\n",
        "\n",
        "**JSON response structure:**\n",
        "The BooksRun API returns pricing information in a JSON format. A typical successful response includes a `result` object, which contains `status` (e.g., 'success', 'error'), `message`, and an `offers` object. The `offers` object typically differentiates between 'booksrun' (direct offers from the platform) and 'marketplace' (offers from third-party sellers), and within these, 'new' and 'used' prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extraction of:**\n",
        "*   **New price:** Prioritized extraction from `offers['booksrun']['new']['price']`.\n",
        "*   **Used price:** If new price is not available, extracted from `offers['booksrun']['used']['price']`.\n",
        "*   **Marketplace price:** If BooksRun's direct offers are not available, the system attempts to extract from the first available `offers['marketplace'][0]['new']['price']` or `offers['marketplace'][0]['used']['price']`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Handling edge cases:**\n",
        "*   **Invalid ISBN:** If an ISBN is not recognized by BooksRun, the API returns a status of 'error' and a message like 'Wrong Isbn'. The system captures this message, and the `Extracted Price` is recorded as 'Wrong Isbn' or 'No offers available'.\n",
        "*   **No offers available:** For valid ISBNs, there might be no current offers (new or used) from BooksRun or its marketplace. In such cases, the `offers` object might contain 'none' values or be empty. The logic gracefully handles these scenarios, reporting 'No offers available'.\n",
        "*   **API response errors:** Standard `requests.exceptions.RequestException` catches network issues or bad HTTP responses. `json.JSONDecodeError` handles cases where the response is not valid JSON. A general `Exception` catches any other unforeseen errors during the API interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:** `real_isbns` (list of valid ISBNs).\n",
        "**Output:** A list of dictionaries (`api_results_real_isbns`), each containing:\n",
        "*   'ISBN Used': The ISBN queried.\n",
        "*   'API URL': The full URL used for the API request.\n",
        "*   'Raw JSON Response': The complete JSON response from BooksRun.\n",
        "*   'Extracted Price': The parsed price (e.g., 'New: $19.01', 'Used: $3.94', or an error/status message).\n",

        "### 5. Task 3: Price Comparison Between Competitor and Our Website\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data merging strategy:**\n",
        "To facilitate a comprehensive price comparison, data from three distinct sources was meticulously merged into a single, cohesive pandas DataFrame (`final_comparison_df`). The merging process ensured that only records with valid and comparable information from all stages were retained.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Our Website Data (`df_books`):** This DataFrame, derived from the initial web scraping, contained the original book titles and their corresponding prices as listed on books.toscrape.com. It served as the baseline for our pricing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **ISBN Data (`df_isbns_google`):** Generated from Task 1, this DataFrame mapped original book titles to their `consolidated_isbn` (prioritizing ISBN-13 over ISBN-10). It acted as the crucial link between the scraped title and the competitor's ISBN-based API.\n",
        "    *   **Merge 1:** `df_books` was merged with `df_isbns_google` using an inner join on the `Title` and `Original Title` columns. This step ensured that only books for which we successfully found an ISBN were carried forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Competitor Pricing Data (`df_competitor_prices_valid`):** This DataFrame, resulting from Task 2, contained the ISBNs and the `Extracted Price` from booksrun.com, crucially filtered to include *only* entries where an actual price was successfully retrieved (i.e., excluding 'No offers available', 'Wrong Isbn', or other error messages).\n",
        "    *   **Merge 2:** The result of Merge 1 was then merged with `df_competitor_prices_valid` using an inner join on the `consolidated_isbn` and `ISBN Used` columns. This final merge ensured that `final_comparison_df` exclusively contained books for which we had both an original price from our site *and* a successfully extracted competitor price.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data cleaning:**\n",
        "Before numerical comparison, the price data, which originally contained currency symbols and descriptive text, required thorough cleaning and normalization. A dedicated function, `clean_and_convert_price`, was developed for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Methodology:**\n",
        "*   **Removal of Currency Symbols:** Characters such as 'Â£' (for British Pound) and '$' (for US Dollar) were removed from both the 'Original Price (Books.toscrape.com)' and 'Competitor Price (Booksrun.com)' columns. The specific encoding `\\u00c2\\u00a3` for '£' was handled.\n",
        "*   **Removal of Descriptive Text:** For competitor prices, prefixes like 'New:', 'Used Marketplace:', 'Used:', and 'New Marketplace:' were removed using regular expressions (`re.sub`). This ensured that only the numerical part of the price string remained.\n",
        "*   **Conversion to Float:** The cleaned price strings were then converted to a floating-point numerical data type. This conversion is essential for performing mathematical operations (subtraction, division) required for price difference calculations.\n",
        "*   **Handling Non-Numerical Values:** Robust error handling was implemented within the `clean_and_convert_price` function. If, after cleaning, a price string could not be converted to a float (e.g., due to remaining non-numeric characters or an empty string), it was replaced with `np.nan` (Not a Number). This approach prevents calculation errors and allows for subsequent filtering of records with missing price data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** Two new columns, 'Original Price (Float)' and 'Competitor Price (Float)', were added to `final_comparison_df`, containing the cleaned, numerical representations of the prices, ready for quantitative analysis."
