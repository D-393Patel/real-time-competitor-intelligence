        "\n",
        "*   **Commented Code Functionality:** The initial scraping script for laptops successfully extracted 6 products from a single page after resolving dependency errors related to Playwright installation. The code was fully commented to explain its functionality, including import statements, Playwright setup, scraping logic for product details (title, price, rating, URLs), and data saving to CSV and JSON.\n",
        "*   **Automated Laptop Scraping (Multi-page):** The modified laptop scraping script was able to automatically identify and iterate through all pagination pages. For the specified laptop category, only 1 page was found, from which 6 products were collected and saved to `laptops_all_pages.csv` and `laptops_all_pages.json`.\n",
        "*   **Automated Tablet Scraping (Multi-page):** A new scraping script was developed for the tablet category. This script successfully identified 4 pages of tablets, iterated through each one, and collected a total of 21 tablet products. The extracted data was then saved into `tablets.csv` and `tablets.json`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Generalize Pagination Logic:** The pagination detection logic was successfully adapted for both laptop and tablet sections. This approach of dynamically determining the total number of pages and iterating through them proves robust for similar e-commerce sites with standard pagination patterns.\n",
        "*   **Error Handling and Robustness:** While the current scripts handle basic errors (e.g., missing elements by returning `None`), further enhancements could include more sophisticated error handling for network issues, unexpected page structures, or rate limiting to make the scrapers more resilient for larger-scale operations.\n"

        "Despite previous attempts to configure `PYTHONPATH` and `sys.path` within the temporary script and subprocess environment, the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scrapy'` persists. This indicates that the Python interpreter launched by `subprocess.run` is consistently failing to locate the Scrapy package. A robust solution in such environments is to ensure that the Python interpreter itself has `scrapy` installed. However, since `pip install scrapy` has already been executed in the main notebook environment, the issue is likely that `sys.executable` points to a Python interpreter that does not properly inherit the package installations. To overcome this, I will explicitly add all relevant paths from the current notebook's `sys.path` to the temporary script's `sys.path` to ensure Scrapy is discoverable. I will also print `sys.path` within the temporary script to debug why Scrapy is not being found.\n",
